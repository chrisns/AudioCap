## Problem Statement

- [ ] Users can edit basic profile fields (name, email, bio)
- [ ] Users can upload and change profile pictures
- [ ] Users can update account preferences (notifications, privacy)
- [ ] Users can change their password
- [ ] System validates all input data
- [ ] Users receive confirmation of successful updates
