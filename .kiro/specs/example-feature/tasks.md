- [ ] 6.4 Add error handling and user feedback

## Task 7: Security & Validation
- [ ] 7.1 Add client-side form validation matching backend rules
- [ ] 7.2 Implement password confirmation modal/component
- [ ] 7.3 Add rate limiting to profile update endpoints
- [ ] 7.4 Create comprehensive input sanitization

## Task 8: Testing & Polish
- [ ] 8.1 Write unit tests for all backend endpoints
- [ ] 8.2 Create frontend component tests
- [ ] 8.3 Add integration tests for complete profile update flow
- [ ] 8.4 Perform accessibility testing and fixes
- [ ] 8.5 Add loading states and error boundaries

## Dependencies
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (models must exist)
- Task 3 can be developed in parallel with Task 2
- Task 5 depends on Task 2 (API endpoints needed)
- Task 6 depends on Task 5 (components must exist)
- Task 7 can be developed alongside Task 5-6
- Task 8 depends on all previous tasks

## Estimates
- **Task 1**: 0.5 days (Database & models)
- **Task 2**: 1 day (Core API endpoints)
- **Task 3**: 1 day (File upload system)
- **Task 4**: 0.5 days (Email verification)
- **Task 5**: 1.5 days (Frontend components)
- **Task 6**: 1 day (State management & integration)
- **Task 7**: 0.5 days (Security & validation)
- **Task 8**: 1 day (Testing & polish)

**Total Estimate: 7 days**
