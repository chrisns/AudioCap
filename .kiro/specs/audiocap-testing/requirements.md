# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AudioCap is a macOS sample application that demonstrates CoreAudio process tap functionality for capturing audio from other applications. To ensure the application continues to work reliably as development progresses, a comprehensive test suite is needed that covers all critical functionality including UI components, audio processing, permission handling, and file operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for all core audio functionality, so that I can be confident that audio processing components work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ProcessTap is initialized with a valid AudioProcess THEN it SHALL create the tap without errors
2. WHEN ProcessTap.activate() is called THEN it SHALL successfully create process tap and aggregate device
3. WHEN ProcessTap.invalidate() is called THEN it SHALL properly clean up all CoreAudio resources
4. WHEN ProcessTapRecorder starts recording THEN it SHALL create a valid AVAudioFile and begin writing audio data
5. WHEN ProcessTapRecorder stops recording THEN it SHALL properly close the file and stop the audio device
6. WHEN CoreAudioUtils functions are called with valid parameters THEN they SHALL return expected values without throwing errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for the permission system, so that I can ensure proper handling of audio recording permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AudioRecordingPermission is initialized THEN it SHALL correctly determine the current permission status
2. WHEN permission request is made THEN it SHALL properly handle both granted and denied responses
3. WHEN permission status changes THEN it SHALL update the observable status property correctly
4. IF TCC SPI is disabled THEN permission status SHALL default to authorized
5. WHEN app becomes active THEN permission status SHALL be refreshed automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for the process management system, so that I can verify that audio processes are correctly discovered and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AudioProcessController is activated THEN it SHALL discover running applications with audio capabilities
2. WHEN running applications change THEN the process list SHALL be updated automatically
3. WHEN processes are grouped THEN they SHALL be correctly categorized as apps or processes
4. WHEN AudioProcess is initialized THEN it SHALL correctly extract process information including name, bundle ID, and audio status
5. WHEN process icons are requested THEN they SHALL return appropriate NSImage objects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI tests for the main user interface components, so that I can ensure the user experience works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RootView is displayed THEN it SHALL show appropriate content based on permission status
2. WHEN permission is unknown THEN it SHALL display permission request interface
3. WHEN permission is denied THEN it SHALL display system settings button
4. WHEN permission is authorized THEN it SHALL display ProcessSelectionView
5. WHEN ProcessSelectionView is displayed THEN it SHALL show available processes in a picker
6. WHEN a process is selected THEN it SHALL enable recording functionality
7. WHEN RecordingView is displayed THEN it SHALL show start/stop buttons and recording status
8. WHEN recording starts THEN RecordingIndicator SHALL show active recording state
9. WHEN recording stops THEN FileProxyView SHALL appear with the recorded file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality, so that I can ensure all components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complete recording session is performed THEN it SHALL produce a valid audio file
2. WHEN file operations are performed THEN they SHALL correctly handle application support directory creation
3. WHEN aggregate device creation fails THEN error handling SHALL provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN process tap creation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error
5. WHEN audio format conversion occurs THEN it SHALL maintain audio quality and format integrity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock objects and test utilities, so that I can test components in isolation without requiring actual system audio resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing audio components THEN mock AudioProcess objects SHALL be available
2. WHEN testing without system permissions THEN mock permission handlers SHALL simulate different states
3. WHEN testing UI components THEN mock data sources SHALL provide predictable test data
4. WHEN testing file operations THEN temporary directories SHALL be used instead of application support
5. WHEN testing CoreAudio functionality THEN mock objects SHALL prevent actual hardware access during tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and reliability tests, so that I can ensure the application performs well under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple recording sessions occur THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
2. WHEN long recording sessions are performed THEN the application SHALL not leak resources
3. WHEN invalid processes are selected THEN error handling SHALL be robust
4. WHEN system audio devices change THEN the application SHALL adapt gracefully
5. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN thread safety SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want every task completion to verify build integrity and test success, so that I can ensure the codebase remains stable throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task is completed THEN the Xcode build SHALL succeed without errors OR warnings
2. WHEN any task is completed THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without warnings
3. WHEN build verification fails OR produces warnings THEN the task SHALL NOT be considered complete until fixed
4. WHEN test execution fails OR produces warnings THEN the task SHALL NOT be considered complete until resolved
5. WHEN code changes are made THEN both build and test verification SHALL be performed with zero tolerance for warnings
6. WHEN any warnings are present THEN they SHALL be treated as failures equal to errors
7. WHEN task completion is evaluated THEN warning-free build and test execution SHALL be mandatory requirements
