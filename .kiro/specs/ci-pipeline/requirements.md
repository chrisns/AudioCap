# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions for the AudioCap project. The pipeline will automatically test the codebase on every push and pull request, and upon successful testing, it will build the application. This ensures code quality and prevents broken builds from being merged into the main branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing to run on every code change, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push is made to any branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL trigger automated tests
2. WHEN a pull request is created or updated THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run all tests
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI pipeline SHALL report the failure and prevent further steps
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL proceed to the build step
5. IF the repository has existing tests THEN the pipeline SHALL run all test suites

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built automatically after successful tests, so that I can verify the build works in a clean environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests pass successfully THEN the CI pipeline SHALL initiate the build process
2. WHEN the build process starts THEN it SHALL use the same build commands as local development
3. WHEN the build fails THEN the CI pipeline SHALL report the build failure with detailed logs
4. WHEN the build succeeds THEN the CI pipeline SHALL complete successfully
5. IF tests fail THEN the build step SHALL NOT execute

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the CI pipeline to work with macOS and Xcode, so that it properly tests and builds the AudioCap application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL use a macOS runner environment
2. WHEN setting up the environment THEN it SHALL install the required Xcode version
3. WHEN running tests THEN it SHALL use xcodebuild with the correct project and scheme
4. WHEN building THEN it SHALL use xcodebuild with the AudioCap project configuration
5. IF the macOS environment is not available THEN the pipeline SHALL fail with a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automatic semantic versioning and releases on the main branch, so that releases are properly tagged and artifacts are distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a successful build completes on the main branch THEN the pipeline SHALL generate a semantic version using lukaszraczylo/semver-generator
2. WHEN a semantic version is generated THEN the pipeline SHALL create a git tag with the version
3. WHEN a git tag is created THEN the pipeline SHALL create a GitHub release with the tag
4. WHEN creating a release THEN the pipeline SHALL attach the built artifact to the release
5. IF the branch is not main THEN semantic versioning and release steps SHALL NOT execute

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback from the CI pipeline, so that I can quickly understand and fix any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN it SHALL provide clear step-by-step output
2. WHEN a step fails THEN it SHALL display detailed error messages and logs
3. WHEN tests fail THEN it SHALL show which specific tests failed
4. WHEN the build fails THEN it SHALL show compilation errors and warnings
5. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN it SHALL show a summary of all steps and their status
